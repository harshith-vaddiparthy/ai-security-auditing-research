## YOUR TASK:

Write a complete IEEE conference paper using the provided research data. 

**Title:** "Real-Time AI Code Security Auditing: Automated Vulnerability Detection and Patch Generation"

**Requirements:**
1. Use proper IEEE conference format (LaTeX)
2. Include all research findings (67+ vulnerabilities, 4 security audits)
3. Reference the previous work properly
4. Make it publication-ready
5. Include methodology section explaining the meta-experimental approach
6. Add results section with statistics and analysis
7. Include discussion of implications for AI-assisted security

**Evidence to incorporate:**
- 5 vulnerable Python files created by AI
- 4 professional security audit reports (CVSS scores 9.5-10.0)
- Screenshots showing the AI process
- Statistical analysis of vulnerability types and severity

**Key findings to highlight:**
- AI successfully created 67+ different security vulnerabilities
- AI then successfully audited and detected all vulnerabilities
- Demonstrates AI's dual capability in security analysis
- Novel meta-experimental methodology
- Real-world applicability for automated security auditing

Please write the complete IEEE paper now, including all sections, proper citations, and LaTeX formatting.
